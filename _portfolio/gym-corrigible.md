As part of the 2024 *Fundamentals of Artificial General Intelligence Safety* course at University of Buenos Aires (UBA), I reimplemented the OpenAI Gymnasium [Dynamic Obstacles](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid/blob/master/minigrid/envs/dynamicobstacles.py) including corrigibility parameters as characterized in [Soares, N., Fallenstein, B., Yudkowsky, E. Corrigibility. Artificial Intelligence and Ethics: Papers from the 2015 AAAI Workshop.](Soares, N., Fallenstein, B., Yudkowsky, E. Corrigibility. Artificial Intelligence and Ethics: Papers from the 2015 AAAI Workshop.)

I presented the [final project](https://github.com/freire-guido/gym-corrigible) and results at a workshop at the end of the course. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17WKN_5E1J_NgZ4n_3d7yq_C8z3lmURvMKptVAYl8Q08/edit?usp=sharing)

Hi, I'm Guido. An avid, Wikipedia editor, trumpet player and statistics enthusiast. I live in La Matanza and defended my [thesis](https://freire-guido.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-thesis) for a data science *Licenciatura* degree at University of Buenos Aires in Dec. 2024.

I currently work in consulting and do AI Safety research thanks to the [AISAR Scholarship](https://scholarship.aisafety.ar/) funded by Open Philantropy. My research interests include bioinformatics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

My aim is to perform work with a high social impact in Argentina.
